Differnce between End Sessiona and End Flow

You might have noticed the two Page Transition options: End Session and End Flow. End Session closes the full chat session (chat conversation or call), where End Flow, closes the flow and jumps back to the last active flow. This is an important concept in Dialoglfow CX. You will need to â€˜close' your flows once you want to jump elsewhere, else you might end up in a nested conversation. By default, Dialogflow CX will try to stick to a conversation flow until it reaches the end. If, while in conversation, you go to another flow it follows the pages until the end of the flow and then gets back to the last visited flow and goes on until it finishes that one too, and so on until the chat conversation was ended with "End Session". This allows you to build complex conversations with deviations
